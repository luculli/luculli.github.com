      <description>In a previous post we backtested our logistic model with walk-forward and we found two useful trading configurations, one for Monday-Wednesday and the other for Tuesday-Thursday-Friday. They are reported hereafter.
   Now, a question we could have is, do there is any way to improve our pnl ? We know that we could try a different machine learning paradigm in order to improve our training metrics (i.e. accuracy, sensitivity and specificity) but, assuming we don&amp;rsquo;t want to go to this direction, we can still try to improve our pnl by reducing our losses.</description>

      <description>The purpose of this project was to analyse some LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data from a drone and to classify the detected objects. Our lidar data is related to mountain regions where there can be different kinds of vegetation, high-voltage electric lines, rivers or houses. This kind of analysis can be useful for power line inspections by a drone or the inspection of riverbeds or the analysis of any other human or natural feature which is detectable by a lidar sensor.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Profits Direction: PnL Backtesting</title>

      <description>In a previous post we developed a logistic model with walk-forward to forecast profits direction as extension of a random forest model with the hope to improve its forecasting capabilities. Unfortunately, we didn&amp;rsquo;t get any better metric (accuracy, sensitivity, etc) and the bare testing of pnl prediction in a single week didn&amp;rsquo;t provide better results either.
However, it is not possible to draw a general conclusion by testing a single case because most of the datasets coming from the financial markets are no stationary by nature, therefore no single case testing can be generalized.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Profits Direction: Logistic Model</title>

      <description>In the previous posts we developed a random forest model and walk-forward validation approach to forecast the direction of trades in a CAC40 dataset. Here we investigate the adoption of a logistic model instead of random forests. Since we still adopt a walk-forward validation, we will actually adopt an ensemble of logistic models, one for each of the walk-forward splitting.
Logistic modeling is quite common in binary classification problems, it is based on simple math which extends the linear regression approach, it has a nice bayesian interpretation and it can be seen as a single-layer perceptron so a first step in the world of neural networks and deep learning.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Profits Direction: Walk-Forward Validation</title>

      <description>In a previous post we developed a random forest model to forecast the direction of trades in a CAC40 dataset. Despite the fact that the training accuracy was extremely high, the forecasting metrics resulted quite poor. Generally speaking, such kind of discrepancy is a clear evidence of overfitting in the learning process: the model is not able to generalize because it fitted too much with the training data.
Of course, overfitting can be reduced by constraining the learning process and therefore trading an increase in its generalization capabilities for reduced training metrics - and this can be done in our case, for example, by constraining the number of generated trees in the random forest.</description>

      <description>Abstract: Nowadays, the market of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) develops progressively with a lot of applications such as: infrastructure monitoring, law enforcement, environment research, goods transportation, etc. However, due to the lack of human observation, communication capacities, and protection, a UAS is an appropriate target for a criminal or a terrorist cyber attack. Therefore, risks related to the cyber-security need to be taken into account during the development of a UAS.</description>

      <description>Abstract: Fair valuation of patents is a difficult task. Analytics methods and methodologies exist to evaluate the financial impact of tangible assets on the performance of a business or a company, but non of them can be effectively transposed for hte valuation of intangible assets like patents. Experts suggest that the increasing volume of patents exchanges in commercial transaction signals the start of a &#34;commoditization&#34; process. A more pragmatic approach to assess a fair price would be the creation of a structured market where patents can be freely priced, traded and used as hedge instruments for commercial transactions.</description>

      <description>Abstract: The design of complex system-on-chip (SOC) requires new methods and tools for the optimization of embedded software which is executed on ever more complex hardware architectures. The tuning of the memory subsystem is particularly difficult due to the many design parameters which are involved and the long time which is required to simulate different design configurations. We propose a very effective mechanism for the simulation of generic memory maps on architectures with instruction and/or data cache memory.</description>

      <guid>https://techvagabond.org/value-based-source-code-specialization-for-energy-reduction/</guid>
      <description>Abstract: The objective of this research is to create a framework for energy optimization of software programs. In particular, this paper presents algorithms and a tool flow to reduce the computational effort of programs, using value profiling and partial evaluation. Such a reduction translates into both energy savings and performance improvement. Namely, our tool reduces computational effort by specializing a program for highly expected situations. Procedure calls which are frequently executed with same parameter values are defined as highly expected situations (common cases).</description>

      <description>Abstract: The objective of this work is to create a framework for the optimization of embedded software. We present algorithms and a tool flow to reduce the computational effort of programs, using value profiling and partial evaluation. Such a reduction translates into both energy savings and average-case performance improvement, while preserving a tolerable increase of worst case performance and code size. Our tool reduces the computational effort by specializing frequently executed procedures for the most common values of their parameters.</description>

      <description>Abstract: The objective of this research is to develop tools and methods for system-level optimization of embedded software that is executed on system-on-chip platforms. In particular, this paper proposes a new instruction-set simulator&#39;s tool flow which has been extended with some retargetability features and multiple program representations. We propose an innovative way to improve the simulation speed, that is a key factor for embedded software optimization, by using a synthesis approach.</description>

      <title>Analysis of DSP-kernel software by implicit cache simulation</title>
      <link>https://techvagabond.org/analysis-of-dsp-kernel-software-by-implicit-cache-simulation/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 04 Sep 2001 14:57:38 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://techvagabond.org/analysis-of-dsp-kernel-software-by-implicit-cache-simulation/</guid>
      <description>Abstract: We introduce a new approach to performance analysis of DSP-kernel software, based on high-level abstractions, called implicit cache simulation. The method can take into account any kind of instruction cache as well as code allocation effects. We show that no loss of estimation accuracy is implied by the proposed abstractions. Moreover the speed of the method is such that it can be efficiently used as a system-level design tool. We compare implicit cache simulation with the trace-driven simulation approach, commonly used in industry.</description>

      <description>Abstract: The presence of real-time software modules which interact with specific hardware architectures is growing in today&#39;s embedded applications. New methods and tools are needed for program analysis and the validation of these designs. The timing analysis of software is an essential aspect because real-time requirements need to be validated and because performance objectives could be missed if the software design does not fit with the hardware design. In this paper, we describe a new timing analysis for software which is executed on architectures with a one-level instruction cache.</description>

      <title>A fast procedure placement algorithm for optimal cache use</title>
      <link>https://techvagabond.org/a-fast-procedure-placement-algorithm-for-optimal-cache-use/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 18 Sep 1998 14:57:38 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://techvagabond.org/a-fast-procedure-placement-algorithm-for-optimal-cache-use/</guid>
      <description>Abstract: We present a procedure placement method for embedded applications. We use the trace-driven simulation to collect information on the use of the cache line and then a heuristic algorithm to perform the placement. The main features of our method are a short computation time and a strong reduction of miss ratio. Experimental results shows an average miss rate reduction of 32%, but better improvements are obtained depending on the specific application.</description>

      <title>A cache-aware scheduling algorithm for embedded systems</title>
      <link>https://techvagabond.org/a-cache-aware-scheduling-algorithm-for-embedded-systems/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 04 Sep 1997 14:57:38 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://techvagabond.org/a-cache-aware-scheduling-algorithm-for-embedded-systems/</guid>
      <description>Abstract: The paper presents a methodology for scheduling real time tasks in embedded systems where the task layout is known at design time and does not change at execution time (static systems) and where the cache miss costs are significant when compared to the normal execution time of the tasks. The scheduling model assumes a time driven dispatching of the application tasks which are ordered in a pre defined sequence. Building such a sequence in a way that is not only efficient but accounts for optimal cache sequencing is the aim of our method.</description>

      <description>Welcome ! I&amp;rsquo;m a passionate of technology with background in computer and electronic engineering. I worked in the semiconductors, high-tech and financial industries. This is my web page. You will find here some of the research I did in the past years as well as some information on past projects I got interested in.
Being curious and always eager to learn, I worked on very different topics during my life. I started doing research for EDA tools, then I applied such ideas to hardware architectures for system-on-chips (SoC) and embedded software.</description>

      <description>The purpose of this project was to design the HW/SW architecture of an innovative audio decoder for extremely high quality music. The main target was to be able to decode, and eventually to stream, several channels of music in lossless FLAC format with bit rate of several Mb/s. Just to have an idea of the target quality and complexity of such design is sufficient to remember that a standard MP3 audio file has a typical bit rate of 128 kb/s for a dual channel stereo, so well over 10X less than our objective.</description>

      <description>Our dataset consists of many possible trades generated by several different strategies and our main purpose is to identify the most useful features in order to detect the trades with positive gain and therefore the winning strategies. After having imported the data, we are going to clean in it up and to reformat them. Each record of the dataframe is a single transaction which consists of three trades. One trade to open the position and two trades to close it.</description>
