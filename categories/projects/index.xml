      <description>The purpose of this project was to analyse some LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data from a drone and to classify the detected objects. Our lidar data is related to mountain regions where there can be different kinds of vegetation, high-voltage electric lines, rivers or houses. This kind of analysis can be useful for power line inspections by a drone or the inspection of riverbeds or the analysis of any other human or natural feature which is detectable by a lidar sensor.</description>

      <title>FLAC Decoder Benchmarking on ARM</title>

      <description>The purpose of this project was to design the HW/SW architecture of an innovative audio decoder for extremely high quality music. The main target was to be able to decode, and eventually to stream, several channels of music in lossless FLAC format with bit rate of several Mb/s. Just to have an idea of the target quality and complexity of such design is sufficient to remember that a standard MP3 audio file has a typical bit rate of 128 kb/s for a dual channel stereo, so well over 10X less than our objective.</description>
