      <description>Abstract: The objective of this research is to develop tools and methods for system-level optimization of embedded software that is executed on system-on-chip platforms. In particular, this paper proposes a new instruction-set simulator&#39;s tool flow which has been extended with some retargetability features and multiple program representations. We propose an innovative way to improve the simulation speed, that is a key factor for embedded software optimization, by using a synthesis approach.</description>
