      <description>Our dataset consists of many possible trades generated by several different strategies and our main purpose is to identify the most useful features in order to detect the trades with positive gain and therefore the winning strategies. After having imported the data, we are going to clean in it up and to reformat them. Each record of the dataframe is a single transaction which consists of three trades. One trade to open the position and two trades to close it.</description>
